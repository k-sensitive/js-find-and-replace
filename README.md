# Project

By: Kim Dang

Description: Replaces a word in a body of text with another word. Find and replace is case sensitive. For example, "SkIlLeT" will not be replaced if the entered word to replace is "skillet". This is to preserve special casing that may have been intentional by the user. 

This app was created with the motivation to practice JavaScript and BDD.
